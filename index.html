            <p class="subtitle">Across centuries of change, every American president 
                has stepped forward to deliver words of hope, unity, defiance, or pride. 
                Their inaugural addresses are not merely political manifestos;
                they are emotional blueprints for a nation in motion. 
                This project traces the emotional journeys of presidential speeches, 
                revealing how leaders shape, echo, and sometimes struggle with the spirit

                <h2>The Emotional Compass</h2>
                <p>Every inaugural speech weaves through a spectrum of emotions, from fierce resolve to soaring hope. 
                    It reflects the vision each inaugurated president offers of what America should become over the next four years.</p>

                <h2>What We Did</h2>
                <p>In this project, we collected all <strong>63 inaugural speeches</strong>, both Inaugural Addresses and Addresses Upon Assuming the Office of President, 
                    spanning from George Washington in 1789 to Donald Trump's second term in 2025. 
                    The texts were sourced from <a href='https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/app-categories/spoken-addresses-and-remarks/presidential/inaugural-addresses'>The American Presidency Project</a> 
                    maintained by the University of California, Santa Barbara. We translate these speeches to retrieve their emotional aspects by using machine learning models.
                    <br><br>Of course, no machine learning model is as advanced as human brains. 
                    So think of this project as a vibe check: it's not gonna produce a perfectly accurate result, but it's a fun, experimental way to see history through an algorithmic lens.</p>

                <h2>Our Model</h2>
                <p>To capture the emotional tone of each speech, we used the <strong><code>all-mpnet-base-v2</code></strong> sentence embedding model to represent each sentence semantically. 
                    We sliced every speech into individual sentences, then used the model to map them against our five emotional anchors: 
                    <span class="text-pride">pride</span>, <span class="text-unity">unity</span>, <span class="text-hope">hope</span>, 
                    <span class="text-resolve">resolve</span>, and <span class="text-anger">anger</span>. 
                    If none of these five emotions fit, we categorize the sentences as <span class="text-neutral">Neutral</span>.</p>

                <h2>Anchoring Emotions</h2>
                <p>To detect the emotion, we measures the similarities of the sentences into anchors. 
                    Some of the anchors are as follows:<br/><br/><img src='assets/images/text-grouped.jpg' style='width:100%;'>
                    <br><br>If none of the anchors matches closely to the sentence, we assumed it as <span class="text-neutral">Neutral</span>.</p>

            Let's start with a modern classic as an example. Barack Obama took the oath of office as the first African American president during a moment of immense peril—
            the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and two ongoing wars. 
            Over a million people gathered on a freezing National Mall, not just to celebrate history, but to find reassurance.

                    While often remembered for <span class="text-hope">hope</span>, our model shows that the dominant emotion here is actually <span class="text-resolve">resolve</span>. 
                    This makes perfect sense given the context: the economy was freefalling. 
                    Obama didn't just offer optimism; he demanded grit. Frequent use of words like "work", "risk", "endure", and "remake" drives the score up, 
                    reflecting a nation that needed to "pick itself up" rather than just dream.

            <p class="section2-caption">
                Now, let's look at a sharp pivot. Donald Trump entered office on a wave of populist discontent, promising to dismantle the status quo. 
                The setting was starkly different from his predecessors—less a celebration of continuity, and more a declaration of disruption. 
                His speech, famously short and punchy, painted a dark picture of "American Carnage" that only he could fix.

                    <strong>The Verdict: Pride & Protectionism</strong> <br/>
                    The model picks up a distinct shift here. While the media focused on the dark imagery, the algorithmic dominance is <span class="text-pride">pride</span>. 
                    This tracks perfectly with the "America First" doctrine. The speech wasn't about complex policy nuance; 
                    it was a blunt instrument of nationalism. The high pride score comes from the repetitive assertion of American ownership like "our country" or "our nation".

                        <h2>The Architects of Hope</h2>
                        <p>The peak of <span class="text-hope">hope</span> often coincides with moments of technological transition or a desperate need for social healing. 
                            <strong>Bill Clinton (1997)</strong> famously campaigned on a 'Bridge to the 21st Century', using his second inaugural to paint a glowing picture of the looming digital age. 
                            Interestingly, <strong>Richard Nixon (1969)</strong> ranks high despite the turmoil of Vietnam; 
                            his speech was a deliberate attempt to 'lower our voices' and offer the hope of peace to a fractured generation. 
                            <strong>Lyndon B. Johnson (1965)</strong> used his address to introduce the 'Great Society', framing the elimination of poverty not just as a policy goal, 
                            but as a moral hope for a more just America.</p>

                <div class="grid-step" data-mode="Anger">
                    <div class="text-card">
                        <h2>The Voices of Anger</h2>
                        <p>In our model, <span class="text-anger">anger</span> often reflects existential friction and political defiance. 
                            <strong>Abraham Lincoln's (1861)</strong> first inaugural carries the weight of a nation splitting in two; 
                            while he sought peace, his stern refusal to allow the Union to be dissolved creates a high-tension <span class="text-anger">anger</span> profile. 
                            <strong>John Tyler (1841)</strong> and <strong>William Henry Harrison (1841)</strong> represent a different kind of friction—the bitter partisanship of the Whig vs. Democrat era. 
                            Harrison's record-length speech was an aggressive 8,000-word defense of Whig principles, 
                            while Tyler's address (delivered after Harrison's sudden death) was a defensive, sharp response to a Congress that didn't yet trust his 'accidental' presidency.</p>

                        <h2>The Sentiment of Pride</h2>
                        <p>The <span class="text-pride">pride</span> score captures moments of intense national identity and the 'exceptionalism' of the American project. 
                            <strong>John Adams (1797)</strong>, as only the second president, spent much of his speech validating the success of the new Constitution—
                            a moment of immense revolutionary pride. <strong>John Quincy Adams (1825)</strong> echoed this, 
                            celebrating the 'Era of Good Feelings' where the U.S. began to feel like a global power. 
                            <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt</strong>'s third inaugural <strong>(1941)</strong> sits at a unique crossroads; 
                            as Europe fell to fascism, his speech was a proud, defiant celebration of democracy's resilience, framing America as the last, greatest hope for freedom.</p>

                        <h2>The Weight of Resolve</h2>
                        <p>When the nation faces an external threat, the rhetoric shifts to <span class="text-resolve">resolve</span>. 
                            <strong>John F. Kennedy (1961)</strong> is the gold standard for this mood; his 'bear any burden' speech was a cold-war manifesto of sheer determination. 
                            <strong>Andrew Jackson (1829)</strong>, the 'Old Hickory' general, brought that same soldierly resolve to his first inaugural, signaling a blunt, 
                            unyielding shift toward populist rule. Finally, <strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt</strong>'s short <strong>1945</strong> address, 
                            delivered from a porch during the height of World War II, 
                            was stripped of all fluff—it was a somber, iron-willed commitment to see the war through to the end.</p>

                            <strong>Abraham Lincoln's (1865)</strong> second inaugural is arguably the greatest <span class="text-unity">unity</span> speech in history, 
                            urging 'malice toward none' as the Civil War ended. 
                            <strong>Rutherford B. Hayes (1877)</strong> holds a high score because he had to—his election was so contested it nearly sparked a second civil war; 
                            his speech was a desperate plea for national reconciliation. Even the combative <strong>Andrew Jackson (1833)</strong> spiked in <span class="text-unity">unity</span> during his second term 
                            as he fought the Nullification Crisis, using his rhetoric to hold the states together against the threat of secession.</p>

                        This era marks the dawn of the modern two-party system. With the Whig party collapsing and the Republican party emerging just a year later (1854), 
                        this is the starting line for the Democrat vs. Republican dynamic that defines American politics today.

                    <h2>The Primary Colors</h2>
                    <p>If we compare the highest moods for each party, we saw that <strong>Democrats</strong> are the party of <span class="text-resolve">resolve</span> emphasized in 29.3% of their rhetoric.
                        This means that most Democratic presidents' speeches contain a nuance of <span class="text-resolve">resolve</span>, with words that emphasized working towards solutions and grit to achieve something.
                        Meanwhile, <strong>Republican</strong> presidents delivered speeches that are mostly dominated by <span class="text-pride">pride</span>, 
                        as we see here that <span class="text-pride">pride</span> tops their list at 28.0%. Their speeches mostly revolved around how the American people should be proud of their 
                        country or how the United States stands as the greatest country in the world.</p>

            <h2>The Algorithm as a Mirror</h2>
            
            <p>
                We began this project with a simple question: <strong>can a machine understand the soul of a nation?</strong> 
                By feeding 63 inaugural addresses into a sentence-embedding model, we tried to quantify the unquantifiable: 
                <span class="text-pride">pride</span>, <span class="text-unity">unity</span>, <span class="text-hope">hope</span>, 
                <span class="text-resolve">resolve</span>, and <span class="text-anger">anger</span>.
                It turns out the data reveals a clear trajectory. The early presidency was a place of stoic duty, 
                dominated by <span class="text-neutral">neutral</span> procedural language and high-minded <span class="text-unity">unity</span>.
                As the nation matured and fractured, the emotional vocabulary expanded. 
                We saw <span class="text-pride">pride</span> swell during the era of expansion, 
                <span class="text-resolve">resolve</span> harden during the Cold War, and <span class="text-hope">hope</span> becomes a professional political tool in the modern media age. 
                The presidency has evolved from a role of administration to one of emotional leadership.
                Our analysis also exposed a fascinating divergence in the modern two-party system. 
                Democrats have historically leaned into the language of <span class="text-resolve">resolve</span> and <span class="text-hope">hope</span>,
                framing politics as a struggle for a better tomorrow. 
                Republicans, conversely, have anchored their rhetoric in <span class="text-anger">anger</span> and <span class="text-unity">unity</span>
                (and, slightly, <span class="text-pride">pride</span>), framing politics as a defense of shared American values and identity.
                <br><br>
                However, we must view these results with a healthy dose of skepticism. 
                Our model is a bag-of-sentences: it understands semantic closeness, but it misses the human spark. 
                It struggles with sarcasm, often misreads rhetorical questions, and cannot feel the tremble in a voice or the roar of a crowd. 
                When Lincoln spoke of "malice toward none", the model sees <span class="text-unity">unity</span>. 
                It doesn't see the thousands of dead soldiers that gave those words their weight.
                <br><br>
                Yet, even with these flaws, the "vibe check" holds value. 
                It acts as a mirror, reflecting macro-trends that are too slow to see with the naked eye. 
                It shows us that the <span class="text-anger">anger</span> we feel in politics today is not new, 
                but a recurrence of the populist frustration seen in the 1890s. 
                It reminds us that <span class="text-unity">unity</span> is often highest not when we are at peace, but when we are most broken.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, this project suggests that while the words change, the emotional blueprint of democracy remains cyclical. 
                We are a nation forever oscillating between the resolve to endure and the hope to rebuild.
